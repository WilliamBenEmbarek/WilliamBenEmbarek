### Hi there 👋

👋 Hi there! My name is William, I’m an Appsec Engineer at Tradeshift and writing my Thesis at DTU about optimization of swap nodes for Kubernetes vClusters and also a CTF player with Kalmarunionen

💻 I’m primarily a DevSecOps engineer, however also have a broad understanding of corporate security, and want to learn more about offensive security, as well as highly technical blue teaming such as malware analysis.

🧗‍♂️ In my freetime I enjoy climbing, currently I boulder but am planning to take my belay certification as well as my lead climbing certification so I can properly climb (and use the autobelay when nobody wants to climb with me!

👩‍💻 I’ve been programming since I was 13, started off in basic web design, however now I do most of my programming in Golang, Python, Typescript or Java, with a little bit of C sprinkled around here and there for various CTF challenges.

🍻 I’m also a craft beer afficinado, best way to get to know me is over a stout or two!

🐴 You might also know me as HestenettetDK.
